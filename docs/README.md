# Documentation

GMA is still in the process of being ripped out from DataHub's git repo. We strongly recommend you look over [DataHub's
documentation](https://github.com/linkedin/datahub-gma/tree/master/docs) for now, as it also covers all information
here.

* [GMA Developer's Guide](developers.md)
* [GMA Architecture](architecture/architecture.md)
* [Generalized Metadata Service](https://github.com/linkedin/datahub/tree/master/gms)
* [Metadata Ingestion](https://github.com/linkedin/datahub/tree/master/metadata-ingestion)
* [The RFC Process](rfc.md)
